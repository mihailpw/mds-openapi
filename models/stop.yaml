  Stops describe vehicle trip start and end locations in a pre-designated physical place. They can vary from docking stations
  with or without charging, corrals with lock-to railings, or suggested parking areas marked with spray paint.
  Stops are used in both [Provider](../reference/provider.yaml) and [Agency](#) telemetry data.
