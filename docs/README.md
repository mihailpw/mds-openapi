## About MDS

The [Mobility Data Specification (MDS)](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification), a project of the Open Mobility Foundation (OMF), is a data standard to enable right-of-way regulation and two-way communication between mobility companies and local governments.

**MDS** is a key piece of digital infrastructure that supports the effective implementation of mobility policies in cities around the world. For a high level overview and visuals, see the [About MDS](https://www.openmobilityfoundation.org/about-mds/) page on the OMF website.

## MDS OpenAPI

The [OpenAPI description](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mds-openapi) for MDS data feeds is managed by the [Open Mobility Foundation](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation). This schema can be used to validate your MDS public or authenticated API endpoint data feeds automatically and on demand.

Interactive online documentation is available on [Stoplight](https://openmobilityfnd.stoplight.io/docs/mds-openapi).

Starting with MDS 2.0, OpenAPI documents describe MDS endpoints and allow for schema validation, expanding on the prior JSON Schemas work. MDS versions are organized by branches starting with a branch for `v2.0`.

## MDS Details

The Mobility Data Specification (**MDS**), a project of the [Open Mobility Foundation](http://www.openmobilityfoundation.org) (**OMF**), is a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that helps cities better manage transportation in the public right of way, standardizing communication and data-sharing between cities and mobility providers, allowing cities to share and validate policy digitally, and enabling vehicle management and better outcomes for residents. Inspired in part by projects like [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/) and [GBFS](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs), MDS is focused on managing mobility services such as dockless scooters, bicycles, mopeds, car share, delivery robots, and passenger services.
