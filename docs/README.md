# Mobility Data Specification OpenAPI

The [Mobility Data Specification (MDS)](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification), a project of the Open Mobility Foundation (OMF), is a data standard to enable right-of-way regulation and two-way communication between mobility companies and local governments.

This is the OpenAPI description for MDS data feeds, managed by the [Open Mobility Foundation](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation).

Online documentation is available on [Stoplight](https://openmobilityfnd.stoplight.io/docs/mds-openapi).

MDS versions are organized by branches starting with a branch for `v2.0`.
