    The Agency API endpoints are intended to be implemented by regulatory agencies and consumed by mobility providers.

    Data is **pushed** to agencies by providers. Providers query the Agency API when events (such as a trip start or vehicle
    status change) occur in their systems.

    This specification contains a collection of RESTful APIs used to specify the digital relationship between _mobility as a service_
    providers and the agencies that regulate them.

      description: |-
        All MDS Agency endpoints require authentication.

        JSON Web Token ([JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/)) is RECOMMENDED as the token format.

        When making requests, the endpoints expect `provider_id` to be part of the claims the JWT. The token issuance,
        expiration and revocation policies are at the discretion of the agency.
