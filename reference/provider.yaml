    The Provider API endpoints are intended to be implemented by mobility providers and consumed by regulatory agencies.

    Data is pulled from providers by agencies. When a municipality queries information from a mobility provider, the Provider API has a historical view of operations in a standard format.

    This specification contains a data standard for _mobility as a service_ providers to define a RESTful API for municipalities to access on-demand.

        All MDS Provider, Agency, and Metrics APIs require authentication. If implementing MDS Policy, Geography, and/or Jurisdiction APIs and endpoints, an agency must make them unauthenticated and public.

        JSON Web Token ([JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/)) is RECOMMENDED as the token format.

        MDS API producers MAY include any metadata in the JWT they wish that helps to route, log, permission, or debug agency requests, leaving their internal implementation flexible.
